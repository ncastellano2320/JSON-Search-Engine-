# Assignment 4: Search Engine 
### WE ARE USING OUR 2 DAY EXTENSION FOR THIS PROJECT.
This is a longer group project! Here are the [Project Instructions](Project_Instructions.pdf).


**Objectives:**

* Work in a team using version control.
* Design a larger system, plan the implementation and submit multiple deliverables.
* Implement a search tree-based map.
* Implement a persistent data structure.


## Timeline 

You have about four weeks to complete the assignment. Start right away! **The lab TA will expect that you already have most of that week's work completed. Come with prepared questions and
be prepared to answer the TA's questions about your code.**

Suggested timeline (see Canvas for early deliverables):

* Week 1: Plan your timeline (see below); design you solution (first UML class diagram); 
    adapt the AVL tree from class to work as a map suitable for the inverted file index and provide tests (Catch2 test would be great).
* Week 2: Implement the document parser; build the indices. 
* Week 3: Implement the query processor; user interface; and add persistence to the index.
* Week 4: Finish code and write the documentation file.
